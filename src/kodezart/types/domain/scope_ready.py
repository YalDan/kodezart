    a topology to order them into — but they are the members a delivery is
    still owed for, so a read that dropped them left the only carrier of
    that fact out of its answer.

    ``unresolved`` carries the keys of the criteria the whole scope still
    owes, as the same closure arithmetic the gaps come from reads them. It
    is on the read rather than recomputed by a reporter, because a second
    reading of what a criterion's workflow state means would be a second
    arithmetic free to disagree with the one the lanes were selected by.
